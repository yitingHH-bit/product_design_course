# Three Counters App

This is a simple Android app written in **Kotlin** using **Jetpack Compose**.
The program demonstrates how to work with state, composables, and UI layout in Compose.

##  Features

* Three independent counters displayed in a **column**
* Each counter contains:

  * A **“-”** button to decrease the value
  * A **TextField** allowing you to **enter a starting value**
  * A **“+”** button to increase the value
* Each counter uses its own internal state, so all three counters operate independently

## Files Included

* **Main.kt / MainActivity.kt**
  Contains the full implementation of the counter app UI and logic.

* **Screenshot.png**
  Shows the running app with the three counters.

* **README.md**
  Overview and description of the project.

## How to Run

1. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
2. Connect an Android device or start an emulator.
3. Press **Run ▶**.
4. The app will launch and display the three counters.

If you want it styled differently (longer, shorter, assignment-style), I can adjust it!
